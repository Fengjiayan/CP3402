This is to give brief understanding about learning journey for week 8 including learning activities & resources, estimated hours, content insights and career/employability/learning insights.

## Learning Journey for Week 8

### Learning Activities & Resources

In previous learning experiences, I had been using a learning approach where I would first look up relevant materials, go through them all, and then proceed with the task at hand. During my previous PHP projects, I often found myself forgetting previous knowledge while coding, making the process quite challenging, as if I had completely forgotten everything I had read before.

In this learning journey, I've acquired a deep understanding of various facets of web development, with a particular focus on mastering WordPress. This experience has been instrumental in enhancing my grasp of content management, theme customization, and the integration of plugins within the WordPress ecosystem. Engaging with WordPress has not only honed my technical skills but also highlighted the importance of selecting the most suitable tools for specific project requirements. Throughout this project, my coding abilities have significantly improved, encompassing both front-end and back-end development, marking a substantial growth in my web development expertise.
    
### Estimated hours

I spend one week to finish this practical.


### Content Insights

During the learning process, I've discovered that adopting an effective learning method can greatly enhance the speed of acquiring computer knowledge. By combining learning with hands-on practice, I can quickly grasp coding techniques, leading to a significant boost in my work efficiency.Balancing old and new content makes the course of study attractive and varied, potentially reducing the monotony associated with continuous learning.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

During this week's work, I have not only experimented with new ways of learning, but also gained insights into the importance of front-end engineering in rapidly evolving fields such as CMS and web development. Adopting a modern approach to front-end development significantly reduces the cognitive load associated with front-end coding and increases code maintainability. The ability to quickly absorb new information while retaining prior knowledge is critical. These skills are not only academic but translate directly into a professional environment where continuous learning and adaptation are key. This realisation also applies to future work.
