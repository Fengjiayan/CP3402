## Learning Journey for Week 8

### Learning Activities & Resources

In previous learning experiences, I had been using a learning approach where I would first look up relevant materials, go through them all, and then proceed with the task at hand. During my previous PHP projects, I often found myself forgetting previous knowledge while coding, making the process quite challenging, as if I had completely forgotten everything I had read before.

This week, as I continued working on my todolist frontend, I adopted a new learning strategy. I used Tailwind CSS as the frontend CSS framework for my todolist. Instead of blindly consulting documentation, I followed the official documentation, simultaneously reading it and writing HTML code. This hands-on approach significantly accelerated my learning progress.
    
### Estimated hours

I spend a day to finish this practical.


### Content Insights

During the learning process, I've discovered that adopting an effective learning method can greatly enhance the speed of acquiring computer knowledge. By combining learning with hands-on practice, I can quickly grasp coding techniques, leading to a significant boost in my work efficiency.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In this week's work, not only did I experiment with new learning methods, but I also focused on using Tailwind CSS and SolidJS to develop the frontend for my "todolist." I deeply realized the importance of frontend engineering. Adopting a modern approach to frontend development can significantly reduce the cognitive load associated with frontend coding and enhance code maintainability. This realization holds true for future work as well.
