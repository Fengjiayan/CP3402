Week 2 Learning Log: Creating a Wine Website
Name: Jiayan Feng
Student ID: 14154574

In the second week of the course, I embarked on a new challenge: to create a website dedicated to wine using a different platform, Joomla, highlighting rich and in-depth articles about wine culture, 
rather than using a modern website layout. To do this, I used Joomla as the primary content management system and delved into learning resources on LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.

Resources utilised
YouTube supplemented my learning with practical Joomla guides and tips.

Time Commitment
My journey with Joomla began on 25 November 2023. I started learning and becoming familiar with Joomla's user interface and its various features. 
The whole process of building a wine site, from conception to development, took about two days. I opted for a more relaxed hands-on learning approach, which took longer but was very beneficial. 
In total, this week's learning and development activities took up about a week.The week's experience was more than just building a website, 
it was an in-depth look at the intricacies of Joomla and how it can be used effectively to create a website specifically geared towards wine enthusiasts. 
It was a journey that combined technical skills with a passion for the subject matter, culminating in a comprehensive and engaging online platform for wine lovers.

Content Insights
In week 2, the project remained the same as week 1 as a wine enthusiast website. My goal was to create a platform that would resonate with wine enthusiasts, 
using a blog-like format that highlights detailed articles within a modern website design aesthetic. 
This approach was based on using Joomla as a content management system and exploring its capabilities through LinkedIn learning and YouTube resources.

Target Audience: Wine enthusiasts
CONTENT STRATEGY: Focus on narrative-driven, comprehensive articles to meet the needs of wine enthusiasts seeking in-depth knowledge and stories about wine.
TECHNOLOGY & DESIGN: Created a website using Joomla that effectively blended technology, design, and content to cater to the interests of wine enthusiasts.

Careers & Employability: This project demonstrated the adaptability of digital content creation, emphasising the importance of versatility in meeting the needs of different audiences, 
particularly wine enthusiasts. The programme also highlighted the importance of market segmentation and targeted marketing, which is essential for career development and effective market positioning within the wine culture niche.
